# ess-smart-equals.el

Assignment in R is syntactically complicated by three features: 1. the
historical role of '<sub>'</sub> (underscore) as an assignment character in
the S language (SPlus may still allow this); 2. the somewhat
inconvenient-to-type, if conceptually pure, '<-' operator as the
preferred assignment operator; and 3. the ability to use either
an '=' or an '<-' for assignment.

ESS uses '<sub>'</sub> as a (default) smart assignment character which expands
to the '<-' with one invokation and gives an underscore on two.
This makes it rather painful to use underscores in variable, field,
and function names. Moreover, \_ no longer has any association with
assignment in R, so the mnemonic is strained.

It is possible to reassign the special underscore to another character,
such as '=', but that raises other inconviences because of the multiple
roles that '=' can play (assignment and default argument setting).

This package gives an alternative smart assignment for R and S code
that is tied to the '=' key instead of the '<sub>'</sub> key. It intelligently
handles the various ways that '=' is used in R (and S) by examining
the preceding context. It works under the assumption that '=' used
for default arguments to functions **will not** be surrounded by
spaces but that binary operators involving '=' *should be*. When
this is enabled, underscore is completely divorced from assignment
and thus can be used directly in names.

This package defines a global minor mode `ess-smart-equals-mode`, that
when enabled for S-language modes causes the '=' key to use the
preceding character to determine the intended construct (assignment,
comparison, default argument). Loosely speaking, an '=' preceded by a
space is converted to an assignment, an '=' preceded by a comparison
character (`<>!=`) becomes a space-padded comparison operator, and
otherwise just an '=' is inserted. The specific rules are as follows:

1.  In a string or comment or with a non-S language, just insert '='.
2.  If a space (or tab) preceeds the '=', insert a version of \`ess-S-assign'
    with no leading space (e.g., "<- "). (Other preceeding spaces are
    left alone.)
3.  If any of `=<>!` preceed the current '=', insert an '= ', but
    if no space preceeds the preceeding character, insert a space
    so that the resulting binary operator is surrounded by spaces.
4.  If the \`ess-S-assign' string (e.g., "<- ") precedes point,
    insert '== ' (a double **not** a single equals).
5.  Otherwise, just insert an '='.

With a prefix argument, '=' always just inserts an '='.

These insertions ensure that binary operators have a space on either
end but they do not otherwise adjust spacing on either side. Note that
in #4 above, the second '=' key is assumed to be intended as an equality
comparison because the assignment would have been produced by an '='
following a space.

## Installation

This package is available on [MELPA](http://melpa.org), and you can install it with

    M-x package-install ess-smart-equals

or through the `list-packages` interface.

Alternatively, you can use [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) by putting

    (depends-on "ess")
    (depends-on "ess-smart-equals")

in the Cask file in your init directory and run

    cask install

to update your dependencies.

Finally, you can put `ess-smart-equals.el` anywhere on
your `load-path`.

## Usage

The package defines a minor mode `ess-smart-equals-mode`
that operates in all S-language-mode buffers (e.g., R-mode,
inferior-ess-mode, S-mode). The minor mode makes it
easy to enable and disable the smart equals functionality.

In any ess-mode buffer, toggle the mode with

    M-x ess-smart-equals-mode

You will likely want the mode enabled automatically
in the appropriate buffers, so put

    (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'ess-smart-equals-mode)
    (add-hook 'inferior-ess-mode-hook 'ess-smart-equals-mode)

in your `.emacs` file. Of course, you will need to install
`ess` first.

Here is an example `.emacs` initialization that uses
the package `use-package` to :

    (use-package ess
      :defer t
      :pre-load (setq ess-R-smart-operators t) ; enables smart commas too
      :init (autoload 'R-mode "ess-site"       
              "Major mode for editing R source.  See `ess-mode' for more help."
              t)
      :config (progn
                (eval-after-load 'ess-smart-equals
                  '(progn
                     (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'ess-smart-equals-mode)
                     (add-hook 'inferior-ess-mode-hook 'ess-smart-equals-mode)))
                (use-package ess-smart-equals :ensure t)))

## Examples

In the left column below, ^ marks the location at which an '='
key is pressed, and in the right column it marks the resulting
position of point.

    Before '='         After '='
    ----------         ---------
    foo ^              foo <- ^
    foo     ^          foo     <- ^
    foo(a^             foo(a=^
    foo=^              foo == ^
    foo<^              foo <= ^
    "foo ^             "foo =^
    #...foo ^          #...foo =^
    foo <- ^           foo == ^
