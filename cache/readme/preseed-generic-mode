# Debian preseed file major mode

A major Emacs mode for editing Debian preseed files.

Works well with the powerful `allout` outline mode that comes as part of GnuEmacs. Check out [the screenshots](https://github.com/suntong001/preseed-generic-mode/wiki/Screenshots) for details.

The `preseed.cfg` in the `master` branch gives a comprehensive list of all configuration options in one big file; whereas in the `separated` branch that big file is broken down to logical pieces, making it easy to customize "locally". For example, the `preseed.020-Source` can be customized into two flavors, one for Debian and the other for Ubuntu.
