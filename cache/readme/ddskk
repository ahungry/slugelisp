=====

Daredevil SKK is a version of SKK (Simple Kana to Kanji conversion
program, an input method of Japanese) maintained by the SKK
development team at

http://openlab.jp/skk

It consists of a simple core and many optional programs which provide
extensive features.  Though it has been well developed, our target is
more simplified core, and much more optional features.
