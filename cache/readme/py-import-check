# py-import-check

Emacs plugin which uses importchecker to find out the unused import in
the Python source code. It hits out the output in the grep buffer.

### Installation

I have distributed it through [Melpa]
(http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/py-import-check) and [Marmalade]
(http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/py-import-check) but incase you
want to install it manually, just use the py-import-check.el file.


### Prerequisite software

You need to install importchecker program for using the plugin. On a
*nix based system, this can be achieved by this command:

    sudo pip install importchecker

### Usage

You can invoke it through *py-import-check* function or
alternatively bind it to any key bindings.
