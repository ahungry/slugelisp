# BERT serialization library for Emacs

Translation to and from BERT (Binary ERlang Term) format.

See the BERT specification at http://bert-rpc.org/.

The library provides two functions, `bert-pack` and `bert-unpack`,
and supports the following Elisp types:
 - integers
 - floats
 - lists
 - symbols
 - vectors
 - strings

The Elisp `NIL` is encoded as an empty list rather than a BERT atom,
BERT `nil`, or BERT `false`.

Elisp vectors and strings are encoded as BERT tuples resp. BERT
binaries.

Complex types are not supported.  Encoding and decoding of complex
types can be implemented as a thin layer on top of this library.

Because Elisp integers are 30-bit, only integers of this size can be
correctly translated.  In particular, BERT bignums are not supported.
