When you start Emacs, package Session restores various variables (e.g.,
input histories) from your last session.  It also provides a menu
containing recently changed/visited files and restores the places (e.g.,
point) of such a file when you revisit it.


Files in the distribution (top level directory "session"):

 * README: this file
