ac-sly
======

Emacs auto-complete for [SLY Common Lisp IDE](https://github.com/capitaomorte/sly "sly"). This is straightforward clone of
excellent [ac-slime](https://github.com/purcell/ac-slime "ac-slime") module where all "slime" words have been replaced with "sly" word. It works (for me at least).
