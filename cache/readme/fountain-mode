Fountain Mode aims to be a full-featured screenwriting environment for
GNU Emacs using the Fountain markup format. For more information on the
Fountain markup format, visit <http://fountain.io>.

  scenes

Requirements
------------

- Emacs 24.4
- [s.el][], the long lost Emacs string manipulation library.
- Exporting to PDF requires [Prince][], which is free for personal use.
  Prince adds a removable PDF annotation on the first page; if you don't
  like it, delete the annotation in a PDF application that supports
  editing annotations, or open the PDF and print to PDF, which will
  remove all annotations.
- If you want to use UUIDs (useful for using notes as linked bookmarks) you'll
  need either `uuidgen` CLT (usually preinstalled on OS X and Linux) or
  [uuid.el][] Emacs package.

[uuid.el]: https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-uuid "uuid.el"

Installation
------------

*For users on OS X with no experience with Emacs, see the
[Absolute Beginner's Guide (OS X)][beginners guide].*

Fountain Mode is available through [MELPA][] and [MELPA-stable][]. I
encourage installing the stable version.

Alternately, download the [latest release][], move the files into your
`load-path` and add the following line to your `.emacs` or `init.el`
file:

    (require 'fountain-mode)

If you want to use the `develop` branch (not recommended) to stay on
the bleeding-edge, clone the repository in your `load-path` and
require as above:

    git clone https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode.git

To load Fountain Mode whenever you open a `.fountain` file, also add the
following:

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.fountain$" . fountain-mode))

Outlining
---------

There are six possible levels of outline subtrees. Section headings
count as the first five levels and scene headings count as the sixth
level, e.g.:

    # section level 1
    ## section level 2
    ### section level 3
    #### section level 4
    ##### section level 5
    ###### invalid section level
    INT. LEVEL 6 - DAY

    An obese man (40s) with a large mustard stain on his shirt exits the
    elevator. He holds a hotdog.

Cycle subtree visibility with `TAB`. Cycle global outline visibility
with `<backtab>` (shift-TAB) or `C-u TAB`. More navigation and structure
editing commands are:

- `C-c C-f fountain-outline-forward`
- `C-c C-b fountain-outline-backward`
- `C-c C-n fountain-outline-next`
- `C-c C-p fountain-outline-previous`
- `C-c C-u fountain-outline-up`
- `C-c C-v fountain-outline-shift-down`
- `C-c C-^ fountain-outline-shift-up`
- `C-c C-SPC fountain-outline-mark`
