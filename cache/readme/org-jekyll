Org-jekyll â€” export jekyll blog posts from org-mode.

Juan Reyero, http://juanreyero.com

Extracts subtrees from your org-publish project files that have a
:blog: keyword and an :on: property with a timestamp, and exports
them to a subdirectory _posts of your project's publishing
directory in the year-month-day-title.html format that Jekyll
expects. Properties are passed over as yaml front-matter in the
exported files. The title of the entry is the title of the
subtree.
