#Github Flavored Markdown exporter for Org Mode

This is a small exporter based on the Markdown exporter already existing in
Org mode. It should support the features [listed here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

The exporter has made it's way into to the `contrib` section of Org, and can
be found here:

http://orgmode.org/cgit.cgi/org-mode.git/plain/contrib/lisp/ox-gfm.el

If changes are made, these will appear here before they are suggested to the
Org mode mailing list.
