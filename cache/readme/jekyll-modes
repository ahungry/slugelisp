jekyll-modes
============

Emacs major modes (markdown and HTML) for authoring content in
Jekyll. Handles syntax highlighting for
[YAML frontmatter][frontmatter], [Liquid tags][liquid] and pygmentized
code snippets.

As this package depends on polymode, Emacs 24 is required.

## Installation

`jekyll-modes` is available from the [MELPA][melpa] package archive.

## Configuration

The package includes two modes, `jekyll-markdown-mode` and
`jekyll-html-mode`, which can be enabled as normal by adding the
following to you init file:

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.md$" . jekyll-markdown-mode))
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.html" . jekyll-html-mode))
