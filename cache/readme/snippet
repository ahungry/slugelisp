==========

The original Emacs Snippet Mode. I wrote this code years ago to
replicate TextMate's snippets in Emacs. It was my first real
undertaking in Emacs Lisp. I post the code here for posterity. 

This code is no longer maintained. Fortunately, the Internet has no
shortage of others willing to improve upon unmaintained code. This
codebase was used as the foundation for another project created by
pluskid called [smart-snippet]. It has since been entirely rewritten
by others and is now called [YASnippet]. If you are looking for a
supported snippet mode, I'd recommend checking there first.
