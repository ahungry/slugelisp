## Requirements

* Emacs 24 or higher
* helm 1.5.6 or higher
* [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) 0.25 or higher.

I suppose you can use older version ag however if you want to use all features of helm-ag, please upgrade ag version.

## Installation

`helm-ag` is available on [MELPA](http://melpa.org/) and [MELPA stable](http://stable.melpa.org/)

You can install `helm-ag` with the following command.

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] helm-ag [RET]</kbd>


## Basic Usage

#### `helm-ag`

Input search word with `ag` command. You can change search directory
with `C-u` prefix.

#### `helm-ag-this-file`

Same as `helm-ag` except to search only current file

#### `helm-do-ag`

Search with `ag` like `helm-do-grep`. You can specify extra command line option
of `ag` with minus prefix(`C--`).

#### `helm-do-ag-this-file`

Same as `helm-do-ag` except to search only current file

#### `helm-ag-project-root`

Call `helm-ag` at project root. `helm-ag` seems directory as project root where
there is `.git` or `.hg` or `.svn`.


#### `helm-do-ag-project-root`

Call `helm-do-ag` at project root.


#### `helm-ag-buffers`

Search buffers by `helm-ag`


#### `helm-do-ag-buffers`

Search buffers by `helm-do-ag`


#### `helm-ag-pop-stack`

Move to point before jump

#### `helm-ag-clear-stack`

Clear context stack


## Persistent action

You can see file content temporarily by persistent action(`C-j`).


## Search Tips of `helm-ag`

#### Passing command line options and pattern

```
Pattern: -Gmd$ search_pattern
```

Command line options is `-Gmd$` and search pattern is `search_pattern`.
`helm-ag` treats words which starts with `-` as command line option.

#### Pattern contains space

```
Pattern: foo bar baz
```

Search pattern is `foo bar baz`. You need not to wrap pattern with quotes.


#### Pattern starts with `-`

```
Pattern: -- --count
```

Search pattern is `--count`.
`helm-ag` treats words after `--` as search pattern.


## Customize

#### `helm-ag-base-command`(Default: `ag --nocolor --nogroup`)

Base command of `ag`.

#### `helm-ag-command-option`(Default: `nil`)

Command line option of base command.

#### `helm-ag-insert-at-point`(Default: `nil`)

Insert thing at point as default search pattern, if this value is `non nil`.
You can set the parameter same as `thing-at-point`(Such as `'word`, `symbol` etc).

#### `helm-ag-fuzzy-match`(Default: `nil`)

Enable fuzzy matching.

#### `helm-ag-source-type`(Default: `'one-line`)

If this value is `'file-line`, `helm-ag` displays candidate as helm `file-line` style.

#### `helm-ag-use-grep-ignore-list`(Default: `nil`)

Use `grep-find-ignored-files` and `grep-find-ignored-directories` as ignore pattern.
They are specified to `--ignore' options."

#### `helm-ag-always-set-extra-option`(Default: `nil`)

Always set extra command line option of `ag` in `helm-do-ag`
if this value is non-nil.

#### `helm-ag-edit-save`(Default: `t`)

Save buffers you edit at editing completed.

#### `helm-ag-use-emacs-lisp-regexp`(Default: `nil`)

Use Emacs Lisp regexp instead of PCRE as pattern.
NOTE: this is very simple convertion.

#### `helm-ag-use-agignore`(Default: `nil`)

Use `.agignore` file at project root if this variable is non nil.


## Keymap

`helm-ag-map` and `helm-do-ag-map` are inherited by `helm-map`.

| Key       | Action                     |
|:----------|:---------------------------|
| `C-c o`   | Open other window          |
| `C-l`     | Search in parent directory |
| `C-c C-e` | Switch to edit mode        |
| `C-x C-s` | Save ag results to buffer  |
| `C-c C-f` | Enable helm-follow-mode    |
| `C-c ?`   | Show help message          |


### Edit mode keymap

| Key       | Action           |
|:----------|:-----------------|
| `C-c C-c` | Commit changes   |
| `C-c C-k` | Abort            |

You can use `next-error` and `previous-error` for seeing file content which
current line indicates.


## Sample Configuration

```lisp
(custom-set-variables
 '(helm-ag-base-command "ag --nocolor --nogroup --ignore-case")
 '(helm-ag-command-option "--all-text")
 '(helm-ag-insert-at-point 'symbol))
```

## helm-ag.el with [the platinum searcher](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher) or [ack](http://beyondgrep.com/)

`helm-ag.el` can work the platinum searcher or ack instead of the silver searcher.
It is difficult to install the silver search on some platform such as Windows,
while it is easy to install the platinum searcher because it is written in
go language and its author provides binaries for some platforms. And ack is written in Perl.

NOTE: Please use pt 1.7.7 or higher version if you use the platinum searcher.

Please add following configuration if you use `helm-ag` with the platinum searcher. I recommend you to set `-e` option which enables regexp searching.

```lisp
(custom-set-variables
  '(helm-ag-base-command "pt -e --nocolor --nogroup"))
```

or using `ack`

```lisp
(custom-set-variables
  '(helm-ag-base-command "ack --nocolor --nogroup"))
```


### For [projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/) users

You can use `helm-ag` with `projectile` by following command.

```lisp
(defun projectile-helm-ag ()
  (interactive)
  (helm-ag (projectile-project-root)))
```

## Alternatives

[ag.el](https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el) provides `M-x grep` interface.
Also it can work without helm.
