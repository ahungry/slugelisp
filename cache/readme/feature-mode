# cucumber.el

Emacs mode for editing plain text user stories

## Installation

### Manual

Copy all the files to ~/.emacs.d/elisp/feature-mode, for example,
and add this to your .emacs to load the mode

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp/feature-mode")
```

### Package.el

`feature-mode` is available in both [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org)
and [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net).

You can install it with the following command:

```
M-x package-install feature-mode
```


### Optional configurations

Set default language if .feature doesn't have "# language: fi"
```lisp
(setq feature-default-language "fi")
```

Point to cucumber languages.yml or gherkin i18n.yml to use
exactly the same localization your cucumber uses
```lisp
(setq feature-default-i18n-file "/path/to/gherkin/gem/i18n.yml")
```

Load feature-mode
```lisp
(require 'feature-mode)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\.feature$" . feature-mode))
```

## Key Bindings

In order to get goto-step-definition to work, you must install the ruby_parser gem (version 2.0.x).For example:

```
gem install ruby_parser --version "~> 2.0.5"
```
