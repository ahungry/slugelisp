# NOTE

There is a **new package** [simplenote2.el][sn2] which uses **version
2** of the [Simplenote][sn] API. It has more features than this
package.

The below package will be kept around and updated in order to support
the existing users.

# simplenote.el

Emacs lisp package that can assist your interaction with the
[Simplenote][sn], cross platform, note taking application developed by
[Simperium][si].

Notice that `simplenote.el` is not developed or endorsed by the
Simperium.

The software is distributed under the GPL license version 2.

## Requirements

This package relies on your system having a program that can establish
secure connections to the Simplenote server, such as `openssl` or
`gnutls-cli`.

### Mac OS X

`openssl` is pre-installed under Mac OS X.

### Windows

Under Windows you need to use `gnutls-cli` under Cygwin (tested with
Cygwin 1.7.5-1). The Cygwin `bin` directory, by default
`c:/cygwin/bin`, should be in your path. ‘Standalone´ versions of
`openssl` or `gnutls-cli` do not appear to work under Windows.

## Installation

You can install it from [MELPA][melpa]:

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] simplenote [RET]</kbd>

Or manually: put the file `simplenote.el` in a directory where Emacs
can find it during startup.

## Configuration

Regardlessly of how you install `simplenote`, add the following lines
in your config file:

```emacs-lisp
(require 'simplenote)
(setq simplenote-email "email@company.com")
(setq simplenote-password "yourpassword")
(simplenote-setup)
```

where the email and password are the ones that you use to login to the
Simplenote application. It is also possible to set
`simplenote-password` to `nil`. In this case you will be asked for the
password when it is required.

`simplenote.el` keeps a local copy of your notes in a directory
defined in the variable `simplenote-directory`. Its default value is
`~/.simplenote`. You can change the value of `simplenote-directory`
before calling `simplenote-setup`. The latter checks for the existence
of `simplenote-directory` and some necessary sub-directories and
creates these if they do not exist.

## Usage

There are two usage modes for `simplenote.el`. It can be used as a
browser for your notes (with local caching) or you can synchronize
individual notes to the Simplenote application and later edit them on
the iPhone. These two approaches do not exclude one another. I will
explain these two approaches below.

### Simplenote browser

Give the command <kbd>M-x simplenote-browse</kbd>. If this the first time you
will see an almost empty buffer. Click on the **[Sync]** button to
download your notes from the Simplenote server. If you have not set
the variables `simplenote-email` or `simplenote-password` you will be
asked interactively for their values.

The rest of the interface should be more or less clear. You have the
option to create new notes, and edit or delete existing notes. Syncing
is not automatic but has to be invoked manually either by clicking the
`[Sync]` button at the top of the Simplenote browser or by <kbd>M-x
simplenote-sync-notes</kbd>.

Deleting a note just marks the note as deleted in order to give you
the opportunity to undelete it if you change your mind. After syncing
the note gets deleted from the local cache but still exists (marked as
deleted) on the Simplenote server. The note will be permanently
deleted only after syncing through the iPhone Simplenote application
or by using the Simplenote API.

### Sync individual files

The idea here is that you have a text file that you want to edit on
your iPhone when you can't use your laptop, for example, during a bus
commute. First, while visiting the text file that you want to sync run
<kbd>M-x simplenote-create-note-from-buffer</kbd>. This will create a new note
on the Simplenote server with the contents of your file. Each note is
identified by a **key** which is saved by `simplenote.el` in the
buffer-local variable `simplenote-key`. In order for the key to
persist after you close the file you must save it. For this reason the
function `simplenote-create-note-from-buffer` adds a file-local
variables section at the end of your file. If your file already has
file-local variables you will need to do some editing.

Then you use the functions <kbd>M-x simplenote-push-buffer</kbd> and <kbd>M-x
simplenote-pull-buffer</kbd> to send local changes to the server and get
changes from the server respectively.

## Future

* Handle gracefully the case where there is no connection to the
  Simplenote server.

## Compatibility disclaimer

This package has been tested only under Emacs >= 23.1.1. Although I
hope it works under older versions of Emacs (at least Emacs 22) I have
not tested it. Furthermore, this is pre-alpha quality software and
there is a high probability that it will cause irreparable harm to
your notes. Use at your own peril and keep a backup of your notes.
