# Major mode for editing Pentadactyl config files

Doesn't really do much besides syntax highlighting, which is nice to
have. Pentadacyl config files are much like vimrc files, so what I've mostly
done is just rewritten the keywords to match those of Pentadactyl. Here's a
comparison between different modes:

Fundamental mode:
