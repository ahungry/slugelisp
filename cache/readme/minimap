==Commentary:==

Heavily based off minimap.el by David Engster however I
have refactored it a bit to support only a single global
minimap window. Usually this should be opened on startup
when there is a single window. Some defaults have also 
been changed.

This file is an implementation of a minimap sidebar, i.e., a
smaller display of the current buffer on the left side. It
highlights the currently shown region and updates its position
automatically. You can navigate in the minibar by dragging the
active region with the mouse, which will scroll the corresponding
edit buffer.

Usage:
 * Put minimap.el in your load path.
 * (require 'minimap)
 * Use 'M-x minimap-toggle' to toggle the minimap.
 * Use 'M-x minimap-create' to create the minimap.
 * Use 'M-x minimap-kill' to kill the minimap.
 * Use 'M-x customize-group RET minimap RET' to adapt minimap to your needs.
