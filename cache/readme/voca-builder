# Welcome to voca-builder

voca-builder is an Emacs package that was developed to help you build
up your vocabulary. It automates most of the steps in the look-up and
record processes, and therefore improve your efficiency and
productivity. 

By using it, you can

1.  spent more time in actually learning and memorising new
    words, and leave the manual and origination tasks to voca-builder.
2.  focus on your reading with minimal distribution without switching
    app to check dictionary.
3.  utilise the smart exporting facility to helps you revise the new
    vocabulary.

If you are Emacs user and trying to build up your vocabulary, you
definitely should give it a try.
