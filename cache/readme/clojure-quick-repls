clojure-quick-repls
===================

Emacs functions for quickly creating Clojure and ClojureScript repls for a project. 

Once the repls are created the usual [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) commands can be used in either a clj/cljs buffer and the forms will be routed automatically via the correct connection.

So no need to manually switch connections! 

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install is via [MELPA](http://melpa.org) using `package.el`.

You can install `clojure-quick-repls` using the following command:

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] clojure-quick-repls [RET]</kbd>

or if you'd rather keep it in your dotfiles:

```el
(unless (package-installed-p 'clojure-quick-repls)
  (package-refresh-contents))
```

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

<kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>

Make sure you have [piggieback](https://github.com/cemerick/piggieback) as a dependency in project.clj.

Also requires [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider). The latest CIDER snapshot should be used since clojure-quick-repls maintains compatibility with the latest CIDER snapshot as closely as possible.  

Usage
-----

Open any Clojure file in the project that you wish to have Clojure/ClojureScript repls for, then 

<kbd>M-x clojure-quick-repls-connect</kbd>

Do not attempt to execute clojure-quick-repls-connect twice, if you need to restart run cider-quit and then clojure-quick-repls-connect. 

You can now connect the browser and execute any cider command in either a clj/cljs buffer and the forms will be routed to the correct connection.

cider-switch-to-relevant-repl-buffer (C-c C-z) 
----------------------------------------------

If you would like to be able to switch to the relevant repl buffer based on if you are currently in a clj or cljs buffer then you need to set the custom variable cider-switch-to-repl-command to clojure-quick-repls-switch-to-relevant-repl 
 
You can set a custom variable using: 

<kbd>M-x customize</kbd>

After setting the custom variable you should have an form under custom-set-variables that looks like: 

```
    '(cider-switch-to-repl-command (quote clojure-quick-repls-switch-to-relevant-repl))
```

so a custom-set-variables form with only this variable set would look like: 

```
    (custom-set-variables
    ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
    ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
    ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
    ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
    '(cider-switch-to-repl-command (quote clojure-quick-repls-switch-to-relevant-repl)))
```
