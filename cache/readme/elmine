# elmine

~elmine~ is a simple package to interact with the redmine restful
webservice easily. Essentially it abstracts most API calls to the
Redmine API.

## Usage

To access the Redmine API you have to specifiy the redmine to access
and the API key to access it with. ThatÂ´s either done via setting the
variables ~redmine/host~ and ~redmine/api-key~

    (setq elmine/host "https://www.my-redmine.org")
    (setq elmine/api-key "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890")

or bind the variables ~redmine-host~ and ~redmine-api-key~
dynamically.

    (let ((redmine-host "https://www.my-redmine.org")
          (redmine-api-key "acdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"))
      (redmine/get-issues))
