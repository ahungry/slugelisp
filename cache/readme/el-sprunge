                              el-sprunge
          command line paste server with Emacs highlighting

Run the server with the following.

    make start

Optionally set a number of properties of the server through
environment variables passed to make.

The following environment variables are recognized.

    EMACS ---- change the Emacs executable used to run the server
    PORT ----- port on which the server will listen for connections
    SERVER --- server name
    THEME ---- Emacs color theme used for fontified pastes
    DOCROOT -- directory in which to store pastes

Requires Emacs 24.3, my Emacs Web Server [1], and Htmlize [2].

The `el-sprunge-after-save-hook' may be used to run actions on every
pasted file.  For example evaluating the following in the running
Emacs server commits every new paste to a version control repository.

    (require 'vc)
    (defun el-sprunge-vc-add ()
      (ignore-errors
        (let ((file (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))))
          (unless (vc-backend file) (vc-register))
          (vc-checkin (list file) (vc-backend file) nil "a paste"))))
    (add-hook 'el-sprunge-after-save-hook 'el-sprunge-vc-add)
