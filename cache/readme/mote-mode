# Emacs minor mode for editing Mote templates

[Mote](https://github.com/soveran/mote), the Minimum Operational Template is a very simple and fast Ruby template engine.

## Installation

Download [`mote-mode.el`](https://github.com/inkel/mote-mode/raw/master/mote-mode.el) and place it somewhere in your `load-path`. Then add the following to your Emacs initialization file:

```lisp
(require 'mote-mode)
```

Then you can enable `mote-mode` in any file you're working with, just by issuing `M-x mote-mode`.
