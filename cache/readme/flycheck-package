flycheck-package
===============

This library provides a [flycheck][] checker for the metadata in
Emacs Lisp files which are intended to be packages.

Currently these checks are only activated if a `Package-Requires` or
`Package-Version` header is present in the file, and checks center on
the validity of the data in that header.

Installation
------------

You'll need Emacs 24 for `flycheck`, so the recommended way to get
`flycheck-package` is as a package from the [MELPA][melpa]
repository. The version of `flycheck-package` there will always be
up-to-date. There are also packages in [MELPA Stable][melpa-stable], which
track the [latest numbered tag][tags].

If you insist on doing things the hard way, first ensure `flycheck` is
installed, then download this code and add the directory to your Emacs
`load-path`.

Then, in your `init.el`:

```lisp
(eval-after-load 'flycheck
  '(flycheck-package-setup))
```

Roadmap
-------

Once this is more useful, the plan is to extract the checks into a separate
`package-lint.el`, which can then be used by this checker and also by
MELPA -- this will probably be essential in order to check multi-file packages
helpfully anyway.

Additional checks for a future package-lint.el, some of which are currently
performed by other flycheck checkers:

- WARN: header line formatting / capitalisation
- trailing line presence / formatting
- URL header presence
- URL header value is a single valid http(s) URL
- WARN: library is called *-mode but doesn't provide a major mode
- WARN: suggest cl-lib vs cl
- keywords separated by only spaces
- use of non-standard keywords
- non-use of standard keywords
- checkdoc failures for interactive functions / defcustoms
- presence of :group for each defcustom / defgroup
- trailing whitespace?
- themes which aren't in a matching *-theme.el file
- files lacking a (provide ...) which matches their name
- use of unsafe local variables
- use of emacs version dependencies
- local variable set in header line
- non-empty commentary
- using commentary to talk about load[- ]path and installation
- lack of autoloads
- references to README files which won't be bundled in a package
- dependencies on unavailable packages / versions
- use of CamelCase identifiers
