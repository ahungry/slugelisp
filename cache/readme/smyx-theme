# Smyx
This is a color theme for emacs. It is based on the smyck color theme by hukl whose goal is "... to create a homogenous work environment which is pleasant for the eyes." You can find out more about smyck with themes for other applications [here](http://color.smyck.org/). Smyx is still in development and pull requests are welcome.
