# evil-annoying-arrows

Entering evil-annoying-arrows-mode makes evil-emacs ring the bell in your face if you move
long distances in the buffer one char at a time.

    ;; Evil annoying arrows mode
    (require 'evil-annoying-arrows-mode)
    (global-evil-annoying-arrows-mode)

Set the `evil-annoying-arrows-too-far-count` to adjust the length.

You can get a much more obtrusive complaint (it opens in a new buffer) with `evil-annoying-arrows-super-annoying-mode`, which means you'll learn quicker. Or throw your computer out the window. Who knows.
