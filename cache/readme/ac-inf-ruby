inf-ruby completion source for Emacs auto-complete package
==========================================================

This plugin provides an [auto-complete](http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/)
completion source for use in [inf-ruby](https://github.com/nonsequitur/inf-ruby) buffers.

**Latest stable version**: see the [latest numbered tag](https://github.com/purcell/ac-inf-ruby/tags), which
will also be the latest version available via Marmalade.

Installation
=============

First, ensure `auto-complete` and `inf-ruby` are installed: I recommend
using packages from [Marmalade][marmalade] or [Melpa][melpa].

You'll need both `auto-complete` and `inf-ruby` to be enabled and
working, so please consult the corresponding documentation is you have
any trouble with this.

Next, install `ac-inf-rub`. If you choose not to use the convenient
package in [Melpa][melpa] and [Marmalade][marmalade], you'll need to
add the directory containing `ac-inf-ruby.el` to your `load-path`, and
then `(require 'ac-inf-ruby)`.

`ac-inf-ruby` provides an `inf-ruby`-specific completion source,
so `auto-complete` needs to be told to use them when `inf-ruby-mode` is
active. To do this, put the following code in your emacs init file to

```el
(eval-after-load 'auto-complete
  '(add-to-list 'ac-modes 'inf-ruby-mode))
(add-hook 'inf-ruby-mode-hook 'ac-inf-ruby-enable)
```

If you want to trigger `auto-complete` using <kbd>TAB</kbd> in `inf-ruby` buffers, you
should bind it directly:

```el
(eval-after-load 'inf-ruby '
  '(define-key inf-ruby-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'auto-complete))
```

Usage
=====

`ac-inf-ruby` should now automatically be enabled in new `inf-ruby` sessions.

Simply trigger auto-completion, and completion candidates supplied by
`inf-ruby` should be displayed, with the "r" symbol on the right hand side of the
completion pop-up.
