PlantUML mode for Emacs
=======================

**NOTE**: This is currently almost only a GitHub mirror of the nice job done by [Zhang
Weize](http://zhangweize.wordpress.com/2010/09/20/update-plantuml-mode/)
as I couldn't find anything like a source repository. Just minor changes were introduced.

Provides a [PlantUml](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/) major mode for
Emacs.

Installation
============

Make sure you have [MELPA](http://melpa.org/) enabled in your ``emacs.d``. Then, you can just

    M-x package-install<RET>
    puml-mode<RET>

Enjoy!

Usage
=====

Currently, the only available documentation is that provided by [Zhang's post](http://zhangweize.wordpress.com/2010/09/20/update-plantuml-mode/).
