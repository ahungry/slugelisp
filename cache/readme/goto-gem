# GOTO gem

Open an installed gem in dired

## Installation

Installation alternatives:

- Download goto-gem.el and drop it somewhere in your `load-path`.
- If you have melpa configured it's available through `package-install`.

# Usage

Issue `M-x goto-gem` to open gem directory with dired.

Issue `M-x goto-gem-grep-gem` to run `rgrep` within an installed gems directory.

Issue `M-x goto-gem-grep-all-gems` to run `rgrep` over all installed gems (possibly quite heavy weight).
