# Comment-dwim-2

`comment-dwim-2` is a replacement for the Emacs' built-in command `comment-dwim` which includes more comment features, including:

* commenting/uncommenting the current line (or region, if active)
* inserting an inline comment
* killing the inline comment
* reindenting the inline comment

As its name suggests, `comment-dwim-2` picks one behavior depending on the context but contrary to `comment-dwim` **can also be repeated several times to switch between the different behaviors**.

# Demo

`comment-dwim-2` repeated 3 times:

# How to use

`comment-dwim-2` is not bound to any key, so you need to set up you own keybinding first. For instance:

    (global-set-key (kbd "M-;") 'comment-dwim-2)

# Installation

This package can be installed from [MELPA](http://melpa.org/#/).

# Customization

An alternative behavior closer to what `comment-dwim` does is available. To use it, add this to your init file:

	(setq comment-dwim-2--inline-comment-behavior 'reindent-comment)

It basically swaps the killing and reindenting behavior, which means that repeating `comment-dwim-2` will by default reindent the comment instead of killing it, and that calling `comment-dwim-2` with a prefix argument will kill the comment instead of reindenting it.
