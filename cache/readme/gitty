# Emacs extension for often-used git commands

`gitty` is a very small extension to `vc-mode` to make common git
commands easier to access than in the normal environment. The idea
is that you do most interaction with git using the command line or
magit, but some often-used commands are accessible easily.

C-x v b is the main new command. It prompts for an existing branch
with tab completion enabled and checks that out. If the entered
branch does not exist, it prompts if it should be created. This
makes switching between branches for quick feature branches much
easier than with `vc-mode`.

`gitty` also provides quick keys to `stash save` and `stash pop` in
the current repository, and to see the current `status`.

For more information, see the docstring for the command `gitty-mode`.

Note, though, that gitty _does_ override some `vc-mode` keybindings
that are less useful for git.

## Installation

If you have package.el configured to use marmalade, the following
works:

```
M-x package-install RET gitty RET
```

Otherwise, just put the gitty.el file somewhere in your `load-path`
and add `(require 'gitty)` to your .emacs file.

Either way, you can use this mode by simply adding this to your
.emacs:

```
(gitty-mode)
```
