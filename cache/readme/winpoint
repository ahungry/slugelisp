# Obsolete

This library is fully replaced by the variable
`switch-to-buffer-preserve-window-point`, introduced in Emacs 24.3.


# winpoint.el, an Emacs library to remember buffer positions per window, not per buffer

When two windows view the same buffer at the same time, and one window
is switched to another buffer and back, point is now the same as in
the other window, not as it was before we switched away. This mode
tries to work around this problem by storing and restoring per-window
positions for each buffer.

To enable this, just run `(winpoint-mode 1)`
