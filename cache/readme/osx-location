osx-location.el
===============

This library uses OS X CoreLocation services to put useful
information into variables `osx-location-latitude` and
`osx-location-longitude`.

Installation
=============

If you choose not to use one of the convenient packages in
[Melpa][melpa] and [Marmalade][marmalade], you'll need to add the
directory containing `osx-location.el` and `EmacsLocationHelper` to
your `load-path`, and then `(require 'osx-location)`.

If you don't trust the required bundled executable
(`EmacsLocationHelper`) which does the communication with
CoreServices, you can build it yourself from the
[instructions here](https://gist.github.com/1416248) or using the
bundled `Makefile`.


Usage
=====

Start monitoring the location asynchronously like this:

     M-x osx-location-watch

To add code which responds to location changes, use
`osx-location-changed-hook`.  For example, you might add a hook
function which updates `calendar-latitude` and `calendar-longitude`
(defined in the built-in library `solar`), and then use
[rase.el](https://github.com/m00natic/rase) to execute code
automatically at sunrise or sunset.

Hook functions take no arguments; when your hook function runs, it can
use the freshly-updated values of `osx-location-latitude` and
`osx-location-longitude`.

Here's an example:

```el
(eval-after-load 'osx-location
  '(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
     (add-hook 'osx-location-changed-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (setq calendar-latitude osx-location-latitude
                       calendar-longitude osx-location-longitude
                       calendar-location-name (format "%s, %s" osx-location-latitude osx-location-longitude))))))
```
