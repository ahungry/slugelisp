# Gruvbox theme for Emacs

Gruvbox is a retro groove color scheme for Emacs. This is a port of the Vim
version originally by [Pavel Pertsev](https://github.com/morhetz) found
[here](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).  Look at the original colorscheme's
repo for a lot of pictures.  Here's a sort of outdated screenshot:

## Installation and usage

The recommended way to install the Gruvbox theme is with MELPA.

### MELPA

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of `package.el` you can
install the Gruvbox theme from the [MELPA
repository](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/gruvbox-theme). The version of
`gruvbox-theme` there will always be up-to-date.

### No `package.el`

The following instructions are for in the case where you don't have access to
`package.el` for some reason.

1. Download `gruvbox-theme.el`, and put it in `~/.emacs.d/themes`. For example:
   ```shell
   curl https://raw.github.com/Greduan/emacs-theme-gruvbox/master/gruvbox-theme.el > ~/.emacs.d/themes/gruvbox-theme.el
   ```

1. Tell Emacs where to find themes in your `init.el` or `.emacs` file:
   ```lisp
   (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")
   ```

1. Enable the theme:
   ```
   M-x load-theme RET gruvbox
   ```
   Or add the following to your `init.el` or `.emacs` file to load the theme at startup:
   ```
   (load-theme 'gruvbox t)
   ```


## Known bugs

None.  For now...


## To-do

- [Anzu](https://github.com/syohex/emacs-anzu#customization) support
- [ace-jump-mode](https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode/blob/8351e2df4fbbeb2a4003f2fb39f46d33803f3dac/ace-jump-mode.el#L287) support
- Light version of theme.

If you want for the theme to support something please open a new issue and I'll
try my best to make it work out. :smile:
