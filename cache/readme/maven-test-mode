This minor mode provides some enhancements to java-mode in order to use maven
test tasks with little effort. It's largely based on the philosophy of
`rspec-mode' by Peter Williams. Namely, it provides the following
capabilities:

 * toggle back and forth between a test and it's class (bound to `\C-c ,t`)

 * verify the test class associated with the current buffer (bound to `\C-c ,v`)

 * verify the test defined in the current buffer if it is a test file (bound
   to `\C-c ,v`)

 * verify the test method defined at the point of the current buffer (bound
   to `\C-c ,s`)

 * re-run the last verification process (bound to `\C-c ,r`)

 * run tests for entire project (bound to `\C-c ,a`)

Check the full list of available keybindings at `maven-test-mode-map`.

`maven-test-mode` defines a derived minor mode `maven-test-compilation` which
allows one  to jump from compilation errors to text files.

## Installation
You can install via `MELPA`, or manually by downloading `maven-test-mode` and
adding the following to your init file:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/maven-test-mode")
(require 'maven-test-mode)
```

## Usage

If `maven-test-mode` is installed properly, it will be started automatically
when `java-mode` is started.

## Customization

### Output format

If you prefer the more 'verbose' `maven` output, change the default of
`maven-test-test-task-options`:

```lisp
(setq maven-test-test-task-options "")
```

### Toggling between implementation and tests

In order to map between the class file and it's test, `maven-test-mode` uses the
variable `maven-test-class-to-test-subs`. This variable specifies a list of
substitution pairs `(REPLACE . BY)` that will be applied to the class file path
in order to find the corresponding test file:

```lisp
(s-replace-all subs (buffer-file-name))
```

If your project does not comply with the default convention, you need to change
the value of this variable.

### Running test defined at point

In order to identify which test method is immediately defined before point,
`maven-test-mode` uses the regexes defined at
`maven-test-test-method-name-regexes`. If your test method definition does not
match the default regexes, you need to add your custom regex to the list with
something like:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'maven-test-test-method-name-regexes "my-special-regex")
```
