# Automatically Play Emacs Tetris

For more than a decade Emacs has shipped with a Tetris game (<kbd>M-x
tetris</kbd>). For those who are too busy to actually play it, this
package will automatically play Tetris in Emacs for you.

Load `autotetris-mode.el` and run <kbd>M-x autotetris</kbd>. It will
run `tetris` with the `autotetris-mode` minor mode enabled, which
tells Emacs to play automatically. The mode can be enabled or disabled
at any time, allowing a human to either take control or pass back
control mid-game.
