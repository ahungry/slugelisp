# ENSIME Emacs

ENhanced Scala Interaction Mode for [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

See our [Quick Start Guide](http://github.com/ensime/ensime-emacs/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) to learn how to install and start ENSIME for Emacs.

Report issues after checking the [ENSIME Emacs FAQs](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-emacs/issues?q=label%3AFAQ) and the [ENSIME Server FAQs](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/issues?q=label%3AFAQ). Please ensure that you're using the latest version of `ensime` from MELPA and have run `M-x ensime-update`. Stacktraces are useful: enable `(setq debug-on-error t)` and re-attempt what you were doing.
