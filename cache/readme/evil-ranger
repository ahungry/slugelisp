## Description

This is a minor mode that runs within dired emulating many of the features of
ranger. This minor mode shows a stack of the parent directories and updates the
parent buffers while nvaigating the file system. The preview window takes some
of the ideas from [Peep-Dired][https://github.com/asok/peep-dired] to display
previews for selected files in the primary dired buffer.

## Installation

Once you have setup [Melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/getting-started) you can
use `package-install` command to install Evil Ranger. The package name is `evil-ranger`.

## Configuration

Most parameters can be toggled on and off and stay within the current emacs
session. Any settings that are desired on startup should be set below. 

### Customizing

When disabling the mode you can choose to kill the buffers that were opened while browsing the directories.
```el
(setq evil-ranger-cleanup-on-disable t)
```

Or you can choose to kill the buffer just after you move to another entry in the dired buffer.
```el
(setq evil-ranger-cleanup-eagerly t)
```

You can choose to show dotfiles at ranger startup, toggled by `zh`
```el
(setq evil-ranger-show-dotfiles t)
```

Define custom function used to output header of primary evil-ranger window. Must
return a string that is placed in the header-line.
```el
(setq evil-ranger-header-func 'evil-ranger-header-line)
```

Define custom function used to output header of parent and preview windows. Must
return a string that is placed in the header-line.
```el
(setq evil-ranger-parent-header-func 'evil-ranger-parent-header-line)
```

### Parent options

You can set the number of folders to nest to the left, adjusted by `z-` and `z+`
```el
(setq evil-ranger-parent-depth 2)
```

You can set the size of the parent windows as a fraction of the frame size
```el
(setq evil-ranger-width-parents 0.12)
```

When increasing number of nested parent folders, set max width as fraction of
frame size to prevent filling up entire frame with parents.
```el
(setq evil-ranger-max-parent-width 0.12)
```

### Preview options

You can choose to show previews literally, or through find-file, toggled by `zi`
```el
(setq evil-ranger-show-dotfiles t)
```

You can set the size of the preview windows as a fraction of the frame size
```el
(setq evil-ranger-width-preview 0.55)
```

You probably don't want to open certain files like videos when using Peep Dired. To ignore certain files when moving over them you can customize the following to your liking:

```el
(setq evil-ranger-ignored-extensions '("mkv" "iso" "mp4"))
```

To set the max files size (in MB), set the following parameter:

```el
(setq evil-ranger-max-preview-size 10)
```
