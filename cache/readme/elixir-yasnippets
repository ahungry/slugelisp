### package.el installation via MELPA

It can be more convenient to use Emacs's package manager to handle
installation for you if you use many elisp libraries. If you have
package.el but haven't added Marmalade, the community package source,
yet, add this to ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
```

Then do this to load the package listing:

* <kbd>M-x eval-buffer</kbd>
* <kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>

If you use a version of Emacs prior to 24 that doesn't include
package.el, you can get it from http://bit.ly/pkg-el23.

If you have an older ELPA package.el installed from tromey.com, you
should upgrade in order to support installation from multiple sources.
The ELPA archive is deprecated and no longer accepting new packages,
so the version there (1.7.1) is very outdated.

From there you can install `elixir-snippets` or any other modes by choosing
them from a list:

* <kbd>M-x package-list-packages</kbd>

Now, to install packages, move your cursor to them and press i. This
will mark the packages for installation. When you're done with
marking, press x, and ELPA will install the packages for you (under
~/.emacs.d/elpa/).

* or using <kbd>M-x package-install elixir-yasnippets
