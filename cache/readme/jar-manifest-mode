jar-manifest-mode
=================

`jar-manifest-mode` is a major mode for editing jar manifest
(`MANIFEST.MF` or `manifest.mf`) files. It provides minimal syntax
and keyword highlighting.

Installation
------------

Just add it to your `load-path` and then `require` it.

I use something like this:

    (require 'jar-manifest-mode "/path/to/jar-manifest-mode.el")
