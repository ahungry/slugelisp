SourceTalk for Emacs
================

SourceTalk plugin for Emacs allows you to initialize a code discussion conference directly from your editor

## Installation

The recommended way to install SourceTalk plugin is via Marmalade

### Manual

SourceTalk plugin depends on emacs-request (https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request).
You'll need to drop emacs-request and sourcetalk.el somewhere in your `load-path`, and then do

```lisp
(require 'request)
(require 'sourcetalk)
```

## Usage

To create a conference execute `sourcetalk-start-external-conference`

You may also want to assign a key binding to this command. Add something like this to your config file:

```lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") 'sourcetalk-start-external-conference)
```
