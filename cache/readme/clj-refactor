# clj-refactor.el

`clj-refactor` provides refactoring support for clojure projects.

Here's a small teaser, helping you add a missing libspec:

![](examples/add-missing-libspec.gif)

## Installation

I highly recommend installing clj-refactor through elpa.

It's available on [marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and
[melpa](http://melpa.org/):

    M-x package-install clj-refactor

## Setup

```el
(require 'clj-refactor)

(defun my-clojure-mode-hook ()
    (clj-refactor-mode 1)
    (yas-minor-mode 1) ; for adding require/use/import
    (cljr-add-keybindings-with-prefix "C-c C-m"))

(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'my-clojure-mode-hook)
```

The more advanced refactorings require our nREPL middleware [refactor-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl).

To install it add the following, either in your project's `project.clj` or in the `:user`
profile found at `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
:plugins [[refactor-nrepl "1.1.0"]]
```

That's it!

Check out the much longer [installation](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/installation) page in the wiki for a less opinionated approach.

## Usage

All functions in clj-refactor have a two-letter mnemonic shortcut. E.g. `rs` for `cljr-rename-symbol`.  Given the prefix choice in the example setup you'd call this function by hitting `C-c C-m rs`

See the wiki for a complete [list of available refactorings] (https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki), demonstrations and customization points.

## Changelog

An extensive changelog is available [here](CHANGELOG.md).

## Contribute

Yes, please do. There's a suite of tests, so remember to add tests for your
specific feature, or I might break it later.
