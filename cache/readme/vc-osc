# osc backend for emacs vc-mode

`vc-osc.el` is a backend for emacs
[`vc-mode`](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html)
which supports interaction with the [Open Build
Service](http://www.open-build-service.org/).

It is a quick hack based on `vc-svn.el`, and has undergone very little
testing so far.

## Installation

Put `vc-osc.el` somewhere in your emacs `load-path` in the normal manner
and ensure that it gets loaded.  Then do:

        M-x customize-variable vc-handled-backends

and add `osc` to the list of backends, or achieve the same in elisp
by adding this to your `.emacs`:

        (add-to-list 'vc-handled-backends 'osc 'append)
