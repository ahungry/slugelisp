# Python Docstring Mode #

This is a minor-mode for Emacs for editing Python docstrings.  It provides
syntax highlighting for docstrings in both ReStructuredText and Epydoc formats,
as well as an override for the fill-paragraph function when editing such a
docstring that will wrap things according to Python community convention.
