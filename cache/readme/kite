Kite is an Emacs front end for the WebKit debugger.  It enables
inspecting, debugging, and live-editing Web pages and associated
resources, such as scripts and stylesheets.

Status
------

Kite is experimental and incomplete.  There are known bugs and many
features missing.

This is under active development and the todo list is long enough so
issues are currently closed.  Pull requests are welcome!

Documentation
-------------

Rudimentary documentation is available in the file `kite.md`.  It can
be translated to HTML, Info, and other formats using
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).  The `Makefile` has
targets for this purpose.
