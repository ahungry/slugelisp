# hl-indent - Highlight irregular indentation

This modes puts indentation highlights below the starting character
of a line on subsequent lines, like this:

```
some line
|   some other line
|   | another line
|   | |                  an indented line
| fourth line
final line
```

This works in every mode, but is more useful in haskell, which
doesn't require indentation levels to be at multiples of a specific
level.

If the minor mode `hl-indent-mode-blocks` is on, this mode will
instead highlight blocks of indentation like so (where different
symbols represent different colours):

```
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  oooooooooooo
  oooooooooooo
       *******
       *******
    **********
  oooooooooooo
    **********
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## To use

Enable `hl-indent-mode`.

There is also `hl-indent-mode-blocks`, but it is less useful
because of limited color contrast, depending on face settings.

## Notes:

- You can customize faces `hl-indent-face` (which is `fringe` by
  default), and also `hl-indent-block-face-1`, from 1 to 6.
- To easily see where `hl-indent-mode` puts its highlights, use the
  function `hl-indent--debug-faces` together with either
  `hl-indent-mode` or `hl-indent-mode-blocks`.
- The mode will refuse to turn on in a very very large file, because
  right now it examines every single line once, which can take too
  long.
- Indentation highlights override any non-trivial background.  This is
  a problem for things like comments that might have a background
  different from the default background. It also conflicts with other
  highlights, like hl-line-mode.
