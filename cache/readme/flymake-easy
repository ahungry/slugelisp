flymake-easy.el
===============

Helpers for easily building Emacs flymake checkers.

Installation
=============

If you choose not to use one of the convenient packages in
[Melpa][melpa] and [Marmalade][marmalade], you'll need to add the
directory containing `flymake-easy.el` to your `load-path`, and then
`(require 'flymake-easy)`.

Usage
=====

This library provides the `flymake-easy-load` helper function for
setting up flymake checkers. Just call that function with the
appropriate arguments in a major mode hook function.

See [`flymake-ruby`](https://github.com/purcell/flymake-ruby) for an
example.
