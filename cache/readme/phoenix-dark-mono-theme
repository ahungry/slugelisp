# Phoenix Dark Mono

This is a mono version of the port of the Phoenix Dark Pink 
theme I found through Sublime Text 2's package control plugin. 
It's a bit rough, but seems functional for me.

I will likely update it, focusing on fixing it for Lisp, Elisp,
Clojure, Javascript, CoffeeScript (ew), Ruby, Rails and various
shells.

## Screenshot

Here's an example of the pink version of the theme displaying Javascript, 
Ruby (Rails), Elisp and Clojure.
