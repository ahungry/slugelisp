# slovak-holidays

This package adds [slovak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia) holidays to the Emacs calendar.

If you have `org-agenda-include-diary` set to `t`, these will be also listed in the `org-agenda` view.

# Installation

If you install from MELPA, then you don't have to do anything as the list will automatically autoload and be added to `holiday-other-holidays` list.

If you install manually, add a call to `(slovak-holidays-add)` somewhere into your `.emacs`.  Note that this must be called *before* Emacs calendar is loaded.
