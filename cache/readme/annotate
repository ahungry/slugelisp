This package provides a minor mode `annotate-mode`, which can add annotations to arbitrary files without changing the files themselves. This is very useful for code reviews. When `annotate-mode` is active, `C-c C-a` will create, edit, or delete annotations.

With an active region, `C-c C-a` creates a new annotation for that region. With no active region, `C-c C-a` will create an annotation for the word under point. If point is on an annotated region, `C-c C-a` will edit that annotation instead of creating a new one. Clearing the annotation deletes them.

All annotations are saved in `annotate-file` (`~/.annotations` by default).

Annotations can be exported `annotate-export-annotations` as commented unified diffs, like this:
