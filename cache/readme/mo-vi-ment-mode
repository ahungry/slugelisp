# Mo-vi-ment
Mo-vi-ment is a minor mode for Emacs that provides vi-like cursor movement that's easy on your fingers. With 
mo-vi-ment mode enabled, you can move the cursor like so -

        M-l
    
    M-j     M-;
    
        M-k

Pressing shift before pressing the movement keys will move the cursor by page (for vertical movement) or by line (for horizontal movement). Pressing control before pressing the movement keys will make the point 'jump' (see `mo-vi-ment-jump-length`).

## Installation
Install it via [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/).

    M-x package-install RET mo-vi-ment-mode

Or drop `mo-vi-ment.el` somewhere in your load path and add the following to your `.emacs.d/init.el` file.

```lisp
(require 'mo-vi-ment-mode)
```

## Usage

    M-x mo-vi-ment-mode

Or, for a more permanent solution, add this to your `.emacs.d/init.el` file.

```lisp
(mo-vi-ment-mode 1)
```
