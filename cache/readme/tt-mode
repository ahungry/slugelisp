A major mode for editing Template Toolkit[1] files in emacs.

This was an afternoon of Emacs Lisp hacking about ten years ago. I'm
no expert in Emacs Lisp so there are, no doubt, many improvements that
can be made. If you have any suggestions then please let me know. Or,
better, clone the Github repository[2], make your fixes and send me a pull
request.

This code is made available under the GPL[3]. Usual caveats apply.
