Overview
--------

  This package implements Parsing Expression Grammars for Emacs Lisp.
  
  PEGs are a formalism similar to the classical Context Free Grammars
  but with some simplifications which makes the implementation of PEGs
  as top-down parser particularly simple and easy to understand.  PEGs
  are more expressive than regexps and potentially easier to use.
  
  For more details and examples, see the header of peg.el.

Installation
------------

  The only required file is peg.el.  Just load it into Emacs.
