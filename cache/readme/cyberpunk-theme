Cyberpunk Theme
===============

Cyberpunk color theme for the emacs 24+ built-in color theme support known loosely as <code>deftheme</code>. The theme is <i>mostly</i> a direct port of the [overtone/emacs-live](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live) theme of the same name (designed originally for the <code>color-theme</code> package). Many mode-specific customizations, listed below, have also been added.

Installation
============

Manual
------

Ensure that cyberpunk-theme.el is on the custom-theme-load-path like this: 

```lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/path/to/cyberpunk-theme.el")
```

You can then load the theme at any time by running the command <code>M-x load-theme RET cyberpunk</code>.

Package.el
----------

Cyberpunk is available in [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/). This installation method assumes that you have added MELPA to your package archive list. This can be accomplished in your init file with the following command:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
```

Alternatively, if you prefer stability you can install from the [MELPA-stable](http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net) repository by instead adding the following to your init file:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
```

Once set up, you can install <code>cyberpunk</code> using the following command:

<pre>
M-x package-install cyberpunk-theme
</pre>

or, by alternatively running the command <code>list-packages</code>, marking the cyberpunk-theme package with the command "i" and running the execute command "x".

If you want cyberpunk-theme to be set at startup, add the following line to your .emacs init file:

```lisp
(load-theme 'cyberpunk t)
```

If you've installed cyberpunk using package-install, you may need to wait to load the cyberpunk theme until startup initialization is complete. In this case, instead of <code>(load-theme 'cyberpunk t)</code>, you may need something like:

```lisp
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 
	  (lambda () (load-theme 'cyberpunk t)))
```
