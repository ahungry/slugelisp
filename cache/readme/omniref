# Omniref

Emacs interface for Ruby documentation search engine
[http://www.omniref.com/](http://www.omniref.com/)

## Usage

When you want to look up a certain term in Ruby documentation, just run

<kbd>M-x omniref</kbd>

if you've selected a region of a buffer, a new page will open in your
browser with the search term. Otherwise you'll be prompted for a term
you wish to search for.

## Key binding

If you find yourself using **omniref** a lot, maybe you'd like to bind
it to something like:

```el
(define-key ruby-mode-map (kbd "C-c o") 'omniref)
```
