# sourcegraph-mode [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sourcegraph/emacs-sourcegraph-mode.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sourcegraph/emacs-sourcegraph-mode)

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Emacs mode for Sourcegraph, powered by srclib, for automatically configured, high-quality programming language support in Emacs. Currently provides:

* documentation lookups
* type information
* find usages (across all open-source projects globally)

for any language srclib supports, currently:

* Go
* JavaScript (Node.js)
* Python
* Ruby

## Installation
First, make sure you've [installed srclib](../gettingstarted.md#install-srclib), along with the toolchains for the programming
languages you're using. Once srclib is installed, you can install the emacs plugin by navigating to your `.emacs.d`
directory and cloning the repository.

```bash
cd ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/sourcegraph/emacs-sourcegraph-mode.git
```

To install the plugin, append the following code to `~/.emacs.d/init.el`.
```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/emacs-sourcegraph-mode")
(require 'sourcegraph-mode)
```

Sourcegraph-mode can be enabled in a buffer with M-x, then typing `sourcegraph-mode`.

Docs and type info are retrieved locally if possible; otherwise they are fetched
from [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com). Examples are always fetched
from [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com).

## Security

Your local code is never uploaded to Sourcegraph, but the "definition paths" of
things you look up are sent (to retrieve examples from the Sourcegraph API). The
definition paths include the following information about the definition under
your cursor (but do not include any source code):

* repository URI (e.g., "github.com/user/repo")
* package name (e.g., "foo" for an npm package named "foo")
* scope path (e.g., `MyClass.prototype.foo` for a JavaScript `foo` method on `MyClass`)
