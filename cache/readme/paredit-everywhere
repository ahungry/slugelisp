paredit-everywhere.el
=====================

It turns out that a lot of the `paredit` key bindings work as
expected in non-lisp buffers, since many major modes provide
reasonable sexp-oriented navigation.

This library, then, provides a minor mode which enables a subset
of the `paredit` library's editing commands in non-lisp buffers.

A grander project offering similar functionality is Matus Goljer's
[smartparens package](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens).

Installation
=============

If you choose not to use one of the convenient packages in
[Melpa][melpa] and [Marmalade][marmalade], you'll need to add the
directory containing `paredit-everywhere.el` to your `load-path`, and then
`(require 'paredit-everywhere)`.

Usage
=====

Enable the minor mode in non-lisp buffers by adding `paredit-everywhere-mode` to
your mode hooks. In Emacs 24 and greater, `prog-mode-hook` is a great choice:

```lisp
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'paredit-everywhere-mode)
```

Use <kbd>C-h m</kbd> to see which paredit commands are available.
