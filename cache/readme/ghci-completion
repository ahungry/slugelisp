# Completion for GHCi commands in inferior-haskell buffers

## Purpose

To support completion for GHCi commands (like `:load`, `:module`,
`:set` etc.) in `inferior-haskell` buffers.

## Installation

To turn on GHCi commands completion in `inferior-haskell` buffers, add
this to `.emacs`:

    (add-hook 'inferior-haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-ghci-completion)

Otherwise, call `turn-on-ghci-completion`.

You may also want to set `ghci-completion-ghc-pkg-additional-args` to
the list of additional argument to supply to `ghc-pkg`.  For example,
this variable can be used to specify which database (user or global)
or which package config file to use.

## Limitations:

* This package is developed for Emacs 24 and it probably only works
  with Emacs 24.  In particular, we rely on lexical bindings, which
  have been introduced in Emacs 24, and on `pcomplete`, which is
  effectively broken in 23.2.

* Only the following commands are supported: `:add`, `:browse[!]`,
  `:cd`, `:edit`, `:load`, `:module`, `:set`, `:unset`, `:show`.  It
  would be nice to have shell completion for `:!`, for example.

* The starred versions of the commands `:add`, `:browse[!]`, `:load`,
  and `:module` are not supported, partly because I don't use them,
  and partly because, for example, `:module` offers completion only on
  the exposed modules in registered packages in both the global and
  user databases, and for these `:module *<mod>` is meaningless.

* `:set` and `:unset` support only a subset of all GHC flags: language
  extensions, warnings, and debugging options.  Adding completion for
  other flags is trivial.  It would be nice, however, to be able to
  generate the list of all GHC flags programmatically.
