# vagrant.el
[![MELPA Stable](http://stable.melpa.org/packages/vagrant-badge.svg)](http://stable.melpa.org/#/vagrant)
## Synopsis

Manage Vagrant boxes from Emacs.

This package lets you send vagrant commands while working within a
project containing a Vagrantfile.

It will traverse the directory tree until a Vagrantfile is found
and assume this is the box you want to work with. It can be handy
to bring a box up, (re)provision, or even ssh to without leaving
emacs.

## Installation

If you have a recent Emacs with `package.el`, you can install `vagrant`
from [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/).

Or via [el-get](http://tapoueh.org/emacs/el-get.html)

Or manually add to your emacs `load-path`.

## Usage

The emacs command `vagrant-up` will run `vagrant up` in a shell, other
commands follow the pattern `vagrant-X` emacs command runs `vagrant X`
in the shell. An exception is vagrant-edit, which will open the
Vagrantfile for editing.

When vagrant commands are given a prefix, you will be prompted for a
box name.  For example: <kbd>C-u M-x vagrant-up</kbd>
