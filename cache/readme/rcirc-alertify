## Install

The recommended way to install this library is to use
`package-install`.  If you wish to go the hard way just put
`rcirc-alertify.el` where you place all your Emacs Lisp files, after
that add the following to your `.emacs`:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/folder/containing/file")  ;; if it's not already in `load-path'
(require 'rcirc-alertify)
(rcirc-alertify-enable)
```

As an additional step, don't forget to configure alert.el to use your
preferred notification system.  In my case that is `libnotify`:

```emacslisp
(setq alert-default-style 'libnotify)
```
