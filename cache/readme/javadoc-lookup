# javadoc-lookup

This package provides a `javadoc-lookup` function for quickly looking
up Javadoc for any library from within Emacs, optionally integrating
with Maven. A browser is launched to view the documentation.

`javadoc-lookup` is not bound to any key by default, so you may want
to add this to your initialization file,

```el
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h j") 'javadoc-lookup)
````

An index for the core Java classes (i.e. java.*) is provided
built-in. Beyond this, you'll want to tell javadoc-lookup what else
you would like to have indexed. There are two ways to do this. You can
point it to the root of a library's documentation on your
filesystem. For example (the first entry here will replace the
built-in index),

```el
(javadoc-add-roots "/usr/share/doc/openjdk-8-jdk/api"
                   "~/src/project/doc")
```

Or, more conveniently, you can **fetch and index documentation from
Maven**! This is done by specifying an artifact as a sequence of three
strings/symbols: `[groupId artifactId version]`. For example,

```el
(javadoc-add-artifacts [org.lwjgl.lwjg lwjgl "2.8.2"]
                       [com.nullprogram native-guide "0.2"]
                       [org.apache.commons commons-math3 "3.0"])
```

This feature requires that you have Maven and the command-line unzip
utility installed on your system. The initial fetch is slow but Emacs
will operate from its own cache after that.

## Import functions

Two functions for managing Java imports is provided: `add-java-import`
and `sort-java-imports`. The former integrates with the javadoc-lookup
index to provide completions.

## History

This package obsoletes my previous java-docs package. Use this one
instead.
