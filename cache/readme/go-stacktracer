# go-stacktracer.el


Jump through Go stacktraces as easily as grep-mode.

![what it looks like](http://i.imgur.com/JXhRieX.png)

# Usage

1. Hit a panic (`debug.PrintStack()` doesn't work perfectly, see
"BUGS" below)

2. Highlight/mark region (you can be sloppy because go-stacktracer is
smart, just be sure to capture the entire line).

3. <kbd>M-x</kbd> `go-stacktracer-region`

4. Use <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd> to move up and down,
<kbd>RET</kbd> to jump to a file (just like grep-mode).

5. Find bugs and submit patches! I happily accept all issues/pull
requests.

# Description

When you hit a stacktrace, mark the portion that you want to jump
through and then call `go-stacktracer-region' with M-x. The
\*go-stacktracer\* buffer will look something like this:

```
main.go:20: main.AFunc()
main.go:15: main.AnotherFunc()
main.go:7: main.main()
```

Use <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd> to go down and up (just like grep-mode,
\*go-stacktracer\* is literally a grep-mode buffer).

go-stacktracer uses a regexp to capture the file path and line number,
so you don't need to be super precise with the lines you call
`go-stacktracer-region' on (though you should be sure to capture the
entire line).

# BUGS

`debug.PrintStack()` prints the function name and file path in
the opposite order that `panic` does. I don't handle that case right
now, so the function names are off-by-one in the view for
debug.PrintStack traces.
