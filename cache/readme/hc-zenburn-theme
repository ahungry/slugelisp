This theme uses the new built-in theming support available starting
with Emacs 24.

## Installation

### package.el

hc-zenburn is available in [MELPA](http://melpa.org/).

You can install `hc-zenburn` with the following command:

`M-x package-install hc-zenburn-theme`

To load it automatically on Emacs startup add this to your init file:

```lisp
(load-theme 'hc-zenburn t)
```

### Manual

Download `hc-zenburn-theme.el` to the directory `~/.emacs.d/themes/`. Add this to your
`.emacs`:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
```

Now you can load the theme with the interactive function `load-theme` like this:

`M-x load-theme RET hc-zenburn`

To load it automatically on Emacs startup add this to your init file:

```lisp
(load-theme 'hc-zenburn t)
```

## Ugly colors in the terminal Emacs version

If your Emacs looks considerably uglier in a terminal (compared to the
GUI version) try adding this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

Source the `.bashrc`(`.zshrc`) file and start Emacs again.
