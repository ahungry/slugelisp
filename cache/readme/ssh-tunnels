# SSH tunnels

This package lets you run and kill SSH tunnels.  To use it:

- Set the variable `ssh-tunnels-configurations`, e.g.:

```emacs-lisp
(setq ssh-tunnels-configurations
      '((:name "my tunnel"
         :local-port 1234
         :remote-port 3306
         :login "me@host")))
```

- Type `M-x ssh-tunnels RET`

- You should see the list of tunnels; running tunnels will have 'R'
  in their state column

- To run the tunnel at the current line, type `r`

- To kill a running tunnel, type `k`

- You may want to temporarily change a tunnel's local port.  To do
  that you may provide a prefix argument to the run command, for
  example by typing `C-u 1235 r`
