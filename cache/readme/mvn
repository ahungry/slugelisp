# mvn-el: [Emacs][0] things for [mvn][1]

By Andrew Gwozdziewycz, licensed under the [GNU GPLv3][2]

This is a few helpers for using compilation mode in Emacs with maven.

### Customizations

If you're maven is in a nonstandard location, `(setq mvn-command "/path/to/ant -emacs")`

If you're build doesn't use "pom.xml", you'll need to modify `mvn-command` to end with with `-f` or `--file` and also do `(setq mvn-build-file-name "somethingelse.xml")` so that the automated project root discovery works correctly.

### Installation

Put mvn.el in your `load-path` and add `(require 'mvn)` to your .emacs

### Usage

The basic operation is to invoke `M-x mvn`, which will ask you for a goal.

`M-x mvn-last` will re-issue the last command

`M-x mvn-compile` will run the standard `mvn compile`

`M-x mvn-clean` will run the standard `mvn clean`

`M-x mvn-test` will run the standard `mvn test`

`mvn` can be called non-interactively too, in which case it's called as such: `(mvn "sometask")`. This means that you can can define your own functions like `mvn-compile` for your projects:

    (defun mvn-compile-full ()
        (interactive)
        (mvn "dependency:sources"))
        
`M-x mvn-kill-cache` kills the internal cache used to speed up the auto-completion of ant tasks in the mini-buffer.
        
### Future

In the future, I'd really like to build a more general mode for working with Java code--something like [malabar-mode][3], but without a lot of the semantic stuff it does. Minimal requirements:

    1. It needs to support navigation really well (jtags does a decent to good job here)
    2. It needs to be able to find code in source jars (if available)
    3. It needs to have a built in way to launch a REPL (clojure, jython, sisc) for experimental programming purposes
    4. Run test at point/file
    5. List possible maven goals
