# Mip-mode [![MELPA](http://melpa.org/packages/mip-mode-badge.svg)](http://melpa.org/#/mip-mode)

Minor mode for quick navigation between multiple projects and files.

# Dependencies

Currently mip-mode depends only on `ido` and `cl`.

# Installation

Easiest way to install would be from [Melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):

```
M-x package-install mip-mode
```

Alternatively, you can download the `mip-mode.el` and add it to your `load-path`:

```
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/vendor/mip-mode")
```

mip-mode can be enabled globally or locally.  To select mip-mode
globally, enter the following to your `.emacs` file:

```
(require 'mip-mode)
(global-mip-mode t)
```

# Configuration

First, mip-mode must be told where your projects are located:

```
(add-to-list 'mip-workspaces "~/workspace")
```

mip-mode considers every directory under a workspace a project.

Projects and files can be ignored:

```
(add-to-list 'mip-ignored-projects "temp-project1")
;; Projects can also be ignored using regular expressions
(add-to-list 'mip-ignored-projects "temp.*$")

;; Ignore all dot files
(add-to-list 'mip-ignored-files "^\\..*$")
```
