flycheck-hdevtools
==================

**Warning: `hdevtools` is no longer actively maintained, so this code is not actively developed.**

This library provides a [flycheck][] checker for Haskell source code
using [hdevtools][]. The checker was split out from the main
`flycheck` codebase at the end of November 2013 due to
[various issues](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/275).

`hdevtools` is a syntax and type checker which caches information in persistent
background daemons, and thus checks faster than plain GHC.

Installation
------------

You'll need Emacs 24 for `flycheck`, so the recommended way to get
`flycheck-hdevtools` is as a package from the [MELPA][melpa]
repository. The version of `haskell-hdevtools` there will always be
up-to-date. There are also packages in [Marmalade][marmalade], which
track the [latest numbered tag][tags].

If you insist on doing things the hard way, first ensure `flycheck` is
installed, then download this code and add the directory to your Emacs
`load-path`.

Then, in your `init.el`:

```lisp
(eval-after-load 'flycheck
  '(require 'flycheck-hdevtools))
```

Make sure that the `hdevtools` binary is present on Emacs' `exec-path`, or
customize `flycheck-haskell-hdevtools-executable` to point to the `hdevtools`
binary.

Usage
-----

When `flycheck` is enabled (e.g. with `global-flycheck-mode`), Haskell
buffers will be automatically checked using this checker.
